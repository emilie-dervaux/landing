        <p>Every year, billions of cigarette butts are thrown away in nature, polluting the environment and endangering wildlife. We decided to take the bull by the horns by creating a startup that transforms these cigarette butts into high quality clothing. We believe that fashion can be both stylish and environmentally friendly

              <h3>We are a team of fashion and environmental enthusiasts, brought together by our belief that the two can co-exist in harmony. We started by collecting cigarette butts in our town, before realising that we could do much more with them than just throw them in the bin. After months of research and development, we came up with an innovative technique to turn cigarette butts into a durable and resistant textile material. </h3>
